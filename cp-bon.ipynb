    "Background:\n",
    "Shyamal is the director of a leading travel and tourism company in India. The company serves foreign tourists only and provide services for arranging stays, local sightseeing and private cabs. His company also prints travel guides for all cities in India for its customers. As of now all travel guides are printed in English Language. Shyamal wants to experiment and provide localized versions to its customers. He wants Yoda to find out which other two languages should be chosen for the travel guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, he wants to finalize five states for the beta launch of new sections in travel guide. Shyamal wants Yoda to suggest top 5 places for eating in these states and highlight the best state among the five selected, as he plans to add content related to the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Audience: Tourists visiting India\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is important to solve: Many tourists who do not understand English will benefit from localized version of the travel guide. Additionally, for state governments of the states selected in top 5, it will be a good excercise to review how they fare. They can run similar data science experiments at a larger scale to improve overall rating for tourists.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this capstone project Yoda will work on Shyamal's business problem and share his recommendations backed by data analysis."
